            Living Faith Church Worldwide (also known as 
            Winners Chapel) is a megachurch and a Christian
             denomination founded by Bishop 
            David Oyedepo in 1981. The church itself began operating on Dec 11 1983, after its commissioning on Sep 17 1983 by Pastor Enoch Adeboye. The organization has since become a global network of churches with congregations in 49 countries

                The beginnings of the church can be traced back to May 1981 when Oyedepo at age 26 said he had an 18-hour vision from God. In this vision God spoke to him saying, “Now the hour has come to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil, through the preaching of the Word of faith; and I am sending you to undertake this task”. Two years later the church was formed with four members.
                    <p></p>
                    On September 27, 1954, Bishop David Olaniyi Oyedepo, a native of Omu-Aran, Kwara State, Nigeria, was born in Osogbo into a religiously mixed family. His father, Ibrahim, was a Muslim healer, while his mother, Dorcas, was a member of the Eternal Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement (C&S), a branch of the Aladura Movement in Nigeria.
<p></p>
He was raised by his grandmother in Osogbo, who inculcated in him the virtues of Christian life through the early morning prayers which he attended with her. She also taught him the importance of tithing and other basic Christian virtues.David Oyedepo was “born again” in 1969 through the influence of his former teacher, Ms. Betty Lasher, who took special interest in him during his high school days. He studied Architecture at Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin and worked briefly with the Federal Ministry of Housing in Ilorin before resigning to concentrate on missionary work.  
<p></p>
David Oyedepo also earned a Ph.D. in Human Development from Honolulu University, Hawaii, United States of America.David Oyedepo received a mandate from God in an 18 hour long vision in May 1981 to liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith. This is the inaugural vision that led to the founding of the Living Faith Church World Wide (LFCWW), first called Liberation Faith Hour Ministries, in 1981. Two years after, on September 17, 1983, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, ordained David Oyedepo and his wife, Florence Abiola Akano (now known as Faith Abiola Oyedepo) as pastors and also officially commissioned the newly started church.
<p></p>
Five years after, David Oyedepo was ordained a Bishop.Living Faith Church (AKA Winners Chapel) started in Kaduna, but David Oyedepo moved to Lagos, the former capital of Nigeria in September 1989, to start a new branch after receiving an instruction from God to reach out to the population in Lagos. This Church in Lagos grew to become the International headquarters of Living Faith Church, with a constantly increasing flow of crowds spilling over to adjacent roads, and on decks of uncompleted buildings nearby, compelling people to stand for hours to listen to his teachings. This led to the building of the renowned Faith Tabernacle, as instructed by God.David Oyedepo is an acclaimed author and publisher who has written over 70 titles apart from periodicals.  He is also Chairman/Publisher of Dominion Publishing House (DPH), a publishing arm of his ministry.  DPH has over 4 million prints in circulation to date. Through God’s grace upon him, Covenant University, Landmark University, Faith Academy and Kingdom Heritage Model Schools have been established to equip the youth for impact.

            The largest church auditorium in the worldDn 1998. The international headquarters of Winners Chapel is called the Faith Tabernacle. It covers about 70 acres (280,000 m2) and is built inside an over 17,000-acre (69 km2) church complex called Canaan Land, the international headquarters of the ministry in Ota, a suburb of Lagos. The building took 12 months to be completed. The foundation laying took place on August 29, 1998. The dedication of the building took place on September 19, 1999 with 97,800 people in attendance. The structure is purported to have been built without any debts and within a year of work beginning.
<p></p>
Between 1999 and 2014 when the 55,000 acre Philippine Arena was completed, Faith Tabernacle was the largest church building in the world. It has a seating capacity of 50,400 people and an outside overflow capacity of over 250,000, with four services every Sunday. Cannanland was procured in 1998 and was initially 560 acres (2.3 km2). Presently it is over 17,000 acres (69 km2) and will take about 120 km to navigate around it.
<p></p>
On Dec 11 2013, exactly 30 years after the church commenced services, Pastor David Oyedepo Jnr, first son of the founder ministered for the first time at the Church’s annual Shiloh gathering. In December 2015, Oyedepo Jnr became the resident pastor of the Faith Tabernacle with unfounded rumours that the older Bishop Oyedepo had retired.
<p></p>
In Dec 2015, Oyedepo also announced commencement of the construction of a 100,000 capacity Faith Arena which when completed would be the largest auditorium in the world. The Theatre will be centralised within a 15,000 housing estate to be known as ‘Canaan City’.

            <hr/>
            <p>
            Every year in December, the church hosts a global event called Shiloh. The mandate for this event is drawn from the Bible books of Joshua 18:1 and 1 Samuel 1:3.
<p></p>
The purpose of the event is to usher the visitation of God to his people. It also marks the end of the Church year.
<p></p>
As of 2012, there were millions in attendance in all the locations and the church website also experienced a huge hit.
<p></p>
The event is held mostly in the first week of December.
